![Mobile Version](images/mobile.png)

This is the first challenge of the Responsive Web Designer path. Really, it was a great experience because although it was a short project, I decided not to use any framework and to do it only with HTML and CSS.
Also, I was able to learn how to deploy in Firebase.

### Built With

- HTML
- CSS
